            <h3>Swim Across the Columbia</h3>
            <p><strong>Knappton Cove, WA to Astoria, OR</strong></p>
            <p><em><a href="https://www.astoriaregatta.com/" target="_blank">2025 Astoria Regatta Festival</a></em></p>
            <p><em>Supporting <a href="https://www.columbiamemorial.org/" target="_blank">BuildCMH</a></em></p>
            <p>This historic swim was first organized in 1934 as part of Astoria's Regatta Festival. In <a href="#" class="tab-switcher" data-target-tab="records">2024 the swim</a> was restored, and 14 swimmers completed the trek from Washington to Astoria.</p>
            <p><strong>Saturday, July 19, 2025</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Starting at 7:15 A.M.</strong></p>
            
            <h4>Location & Course</h4>
            <p>The course is approximately 6 miles (10 km) beginning on the north shore of the lower Columbia River in Knappton Cove. Swimmers will enter the water on the beach directly in front of the Knappton Cove Heritage Center. The finish is at the Astoria City Wharf adjacent to the Columbia River Maritime Museum. The distance is 5.1 miles as the crow flies but swimmers will be led upriver with the incoming tide which will lengthen this adventure swim to well over 6 miles.</p>
            <div class="overview-image">
              <img src="assets/sacRoute.png" alt="Event Image">
            </div>
            <p>Water temperature is expected to be 64–70 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
            
            <h4>Tides & Start Time</h4>
            <p>High tide on July 19, 2025, is 9:23 am. The swim will start at 7:15 am and all swimmers must be out of the water by 11:15 am.</p>
            
            <h4>Entry & Registration</h4>
            <p>Entry is limited to the first 40 entrants. We will maintain a waiting list in case early entrants drop out. To qualify, swimmers must show that they have completed a minimum 5000 m/5500 yd swim faster than 1:40, within 3 years of race day. (2024 Swim Across the Columbia finishers qualify.) Swimmers who cannot complete one mile in open water in 35 minutes should NOT enter.</p>
            <p>All entries MUST be registered by 4:59 pm Pacific time on Sunday, July 13, 2025. Due to organization & safety needs, late or day-of-race entries will not be accepted.</p>
            
            <h4>Perspective Swimmers</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>This swim should only be attempted by experienced open water swimmers. Tidal and river currents, potential debris, and boating traffic including large commercial vessels makes this course high-risk for participating swimmers.</li>
                <li>Qualifying swims do not have to take place during competition, but registration requires the location of the swim and the signature of an observer.</li>
                <li>If you make a mistake in your entry, we will make a good-faith effort to get your correct qualifying swim information. However, swimmers who cannot provide appropriate qualifying time information WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO SWIM and their entry fee will not be refunded.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h4>Cancellation Policy</h4>
            <p>Swimmers who do not participate, or who do not complete the swim, are not eligible for refunds. If the swim is canceled up to 60 days prior to race day, 50% of entry fees will be refunded. If the swim is canceled less than 60 days prior to race day, no fees will be refunded.</p>
            
            <h4>Rules</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>SAFETY TOW BUOYS (STBs):</strong> All swimmers MUST wear the STB during their entire swim. STBs are defined as inflatable buoys tethered to the waist of the swimmer.</li>
                <li>Swimmers must wear the cap provided in their swim packet.</li>
                <li>Swimmers must notify race organizers by Friday, June 28, 2024, if the cap cannot be worn for medical reasons. You will need to wear a suitable cap of the color assigned to you for your wave.</li>
                <li>This adventure swim will allow wetsuits and swim fins.</li>
                <li>Each swimmer must have a personal watercraft as an escort — kayak, paddler, or jet ski.</li>
                <li>Watercraft with props must maintain a safe distance from swimmers — 10 meter minimum.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Cut-Off Times</h4>
            <p>Checkpoints will be established. Time standards for each checkpoint will be explained at the pre-race meeting. Swimmers must complete the swim by 11:15 am.</p>
            
            <h4>Safety — Our Primary Concern</h4>
            <p>Safety boats will monitor the entire course and medical personnel will be on site at the finish. Swimmers are required to have an escort craft (kayak, SUP, jet ski) in a life vest and equipped with an additional life vest for the swimmer. Each escort will be provided additional mandatory race-specific safety materials. Swimmers MUST wear the brightly-colored swim cap and use the STB provided in their race packet. Swimmers and escorts must follow all announced safety rules without exception.</p>
            
            <h4>Escorts</h4>
            <p>Swimmers are required to have an escort in a craft (e.g., kayak). Swimmers must provide their own escort and craft. For swimmer safety, watercraft with props are not permitted to escort swimmers. Solo swimmers coming to the race from out of the area may request a volunteer escort in their registration form. We'll do our best to hook you up.</p>
